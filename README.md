# Title: Home Offline DNS Block List
#
# This is a collection of hosts that Home Offline have found applications to be communicating with or via proactive research.
# The hosts are telemetry, ads-servers or (spy)services that should not be used and should be blocked.
# The list was created since they were not blocked by my active subscriptions in Pi-Hole.
# If you use spyservices such as safebrowsing, google smtp etc. this list _will_ break your internet, it is what it is.
